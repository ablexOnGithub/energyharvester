## Sensor connections
In general all sensor sockets (Grove layout) have a switchable Vcc line. It is off by default and has to enabled by corresponding GPIO lines.

## I2C
There are 2 hardware I2C ports in the 328PB. Arduino currently supports one out of the box (running as a 328P Arduino Pro Mini clone). The second I2C port is prepared for future use.

### Grove I2C 01
The SDA and SCL lines of the socket are connected to PC4 and PC5 accordingly.

__GPIO PD4 == High (1) activates Vcc__

When activating Vcc, additionally SDA and SCL are pulled high to Vcc via 10 kOhm resistors. 

### Grove I2C 02
The SDA1 and SCL1 lines of the socket are connected to PE0 and PE1 accordingly.

__GPIO PD5 == High (1) activates Vcc__

When activating Vcc, additionally SDA1 and SCL1 are pulled high to Vcc via 10 kOhm resistors.

## Grove Analog
The analog signal connected to the socket is fed into the ADC1 input of the AVR.

__GPIO PD6 == High (1) activates Vcc__

## Grove Digital
Vcc on the digital Grove socket is permanently supplied.

__GPIO PD3 == Data input for digital sensor__

## Energy harvesting power supply
The Energy Harvester integrates a harvesting power supply chip BQ25570 from Texas Instruments. It provides the 3.3V Vcc supply voltage for the AVR and attached sensors. It also provides the charging voltage for the batteries and the supercap. It also features MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking), to extract maximum energy from solar panels even in low light scenarios. Other power sources like thermal energy generators (TEG) can also be adapted as power source. 5.5V is the maximum allowed charge voltage level of the BQ25570. And the maximum input voltage of the power source is 5.1V. The allowed peak input power is 510mW, thus a solar cell for this energy harvester should be selected accordingly and cells > 0.5W seem not to be feasible. A better approach would be to use two 0.25W cells in parallel to adapt to the sun path by pointing into different directions. Then, bypass diodes might have to added to the solar cells.

## Configuration of battery type

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ablexOnGithub/energyharvester/master/img/LiFePo_configuration.PNG" alt="Example of resistor configuration sheet">

The image shows a resistor configuration sheet (example of LiFePo configuration), provided as a template by Texas Instruments. The sheet references the predecessor BQ25505, which provides the same configuration system with multiple resistors. All resistors are 1% 1/10W SMD parts in size 0603.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ablexOnGithub/energyharvester/master/img/Config_resistors.PNG" alt="Location of configuration resistors on PCB">

To configure the harvester for LiPo or LiFePo battery cells the corresponding resistors have to have the following values. This mainly adjusts the overvoltage level.

__Info for Supercap mode:__ I'm currently trying out a Vishay supercap with 90F capacity at 5V. This will not have a backup battery. Idea is to increase overvoltage level to 5V (instead of 4.2/3.6V), to have more headroom for the Buck converter to longer provide 3.3V to the sensor electronics. Hopefully this is a solution for sensors that really need stable 3.3V supply. The LiPo/LiFePo configurations are running until below 3V. This currently is an untested resistor configuration!!! 

Part 	| Li-Po cells | LiFePo cells	| Supercap mode 
--- | ---	| ---	| ---
ROK1 	| 4.99 MOhm	| 4.99 MOhm	| 4.22 MOhm
ROK2_1	| 3.3 MOhm	| 4.99 MOhm	| 4.02 MOhm
ROK2_2	| 4.02 MOhm	| 1 MOhm	| 3.3 MOhm
ROK3 	| 806 kOhm	| 1 MOhm	| 681 kOhm
ROV1	| 5.62 MOhm	| 4.99 MOhm	| 3.6 MOhm
ROV2_1	| 4.02 MOhm	| 4.02 MOhm	| 3.0 MOhm
ROV2_2  | 3.3 MOhm	| 806 kOhm	| 3.3 MOhm
ROC1a 	| 3.3 MOhm	| 3.3 MOhm	| 3.3 MOhm
ROC1b 	| 10 MOhm	| 10 MOhm	| 10 MOhm
ROC2a	| 1 MOhm	| 1 MOhm	| 1 MOhm
ROC2b 	| 5.6 MOhm	| 5.6 MOhm	| 5.6 MOhm

## Tracking of Vcc
Using a voltage divider Vcc is measured against the AVR internal reference voltage (1.1V, selected via Software, AVR reference "INTERNAL"). The corresponding voltage is fed into ADC0 of the AVR, to allow for a dynamic adjustment of the sleep interval, related to the actual Vcc voltage level. The lower Vcc the longer the sleep intervall to safe power. Vcc can only be measured, while analog Grove port is activated by __GPIO PD6 == High__.

# PCB Bring Up

## Test of Boost function
* Connect a 3V to 4V power supply with the solar connector X1, simulation a solar cell.
* Measure the open circuit voltage at the battery connector X2, which shall be the configured Overvoltage level
* After connecting a power supply it may take about 1 minute to charge the 1F supercap to the corresponding voltage level 4.2V, 3.6V or 5V
* Now connect a battery or a supercap, depending on build variant, that is compatible to the measured voltage level

## Test of Buck function
* Set __VOUT_EN__ active by bridging the corresponding jumper pads
* Measure voltage Vcc at 5-pin header and expect to see ca. 3.3V 
                                                                                                                        
## Programming of Arduino bootloader
* Set __VCC__ active by bridging the corresponding jumper pads
* Set __ISP_RST__ active by bridging the corresponding jumper pads
* Connect the ISP adapter (z.B. ATMEL  JTAGICE3) with the programming port
* Program a matching Arduino bootloader into the AVR     

## Fuse Bits

After programming the bootloader, we have to set the fuse bits to match the hardware features.

Fuse | Value
--- | ---
CFD | "CFD_DISABLED"
BODLEVEL | "DISABLED"
RSTDISBL | unset
DWEN | unset
SPIEN | set
WDTON | unset
EESAVE | set
BOOTSZ | "256W_3F00"
BOOTRST | set
CKDIV8 | unset
CKOUT | unset
SUT_CKSEL | "EXTXOSC_8MHZ_XX_16KCK_14CK_65MS"

These flags evaluate to the following bit masks:

__EXTENDED__= 0xF7
__HIGH__	= 0xD6
__LOW__		= 0xFF             

## Enable Reset lines
* Set __RESET__ active by bridging the corresponding jumper pads
	* This enables reset per switch and Arduino serial adapter (e.g. FTDI USB2COM)
* Set __VBAT_OK__ active by bridging the corresponding jumper pads
	* This enables reset by power good signal from bq25570 going low in case of battery undervoltage
 
## Test of serial connection 
* Connect a serial adapter
* Compile and download a simple Arduino sketch for the 328PB and check for valid debug output in serial console of Arduino
* This checks for a working serial port and a functioning bootloader

## Connecting RFM95 I/O

# Software

## Configuration of Arduino IDE
Avrdude has to be configured to ignore the changed chip ID of the AVR ATMega328PB when uploading a new Arduino sketch. This is done by adding a '-F' to the command line options of verbose mode for avrdude in Arduino's __platform.txt__ document. There are three lines to edit.
...
tools.avrdude.upload.params.verbose=-v -F
tools.avrdude.program.params.verbose=-v -F
...
